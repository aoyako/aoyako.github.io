      <description>Welcome to my series on microchip-image extraction techniques. This algorithm was designed during my internship in a microchip manufacturing factory. Its primary objective is to autonomously compute the sizes and positions of chips within a package, simplifying subsequent processing by a machine operator. Our approach relies on employing discrete Fourier transformations on images, and a method was chosen for its efficacy in distinguishing repetitive patterns. You can find full code in my GitHub.</description>
